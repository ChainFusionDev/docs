# Transfer Confirmation

Validators constantly monitor bridging events on all supported blockchains. Once they see a transfer event on **source** chain, they start the process of signing transaction on **destination** chain. This transaction confirms that all the validators seen this event and transfer really took place. After transaction is executed, bridge user receives his funds on **destination** chain.
