# Becoming a Validator

Validators play a key role in bridge operation. To become one and be able to receive rewards during validation process, you need to stake at least **10 ETH** into a staking contract and run a node. More stake increases validation rewards in **CFN**.

Be aware, that before staking, you would need to [start a node](running-a-node.md) first. Node should be fully synchronized and configured with the same account you are staking from. It's your responsibility to make sure validator node does not go offline for too long period of time, as it may result in [slashing](slashing.md) by other validators.
