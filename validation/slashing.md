# Slashing

During validation process, participants actively monitor each other to check if they cooperate by consensus rules. In case validators nodes see any non-cooperative participant, they vote against him on-chain.

### Validator responsibilities

List of main validator responsibilities:

* produce new blocks in ChainFusion network
* participate in DKG when validators list is changed
* participate in threshold signatures creation to confirm bridge transfers
* slash misbehaving validators
